        <h1 class="cover-heading">Why is this important?</h1>
        <p class="lead">Programming languages use classes and functions that control commands. The reason that programming is so important is that it directs a computer to complete these commands over and over again, so people do not have to do the task repeatedly. Instead, the software can do it automatically and accurately.</p>
